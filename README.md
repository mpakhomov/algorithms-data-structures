Algorithms and data structures in Java programming language
==============

My implementation of various algorithms and data structures. Also, I keep in this repository my experiments with
data structures / algorithms from JDK, Google Guava, Apache Commons etc.

Java 8 is required, because there is no point in using old versions in a just-for-fun project.
